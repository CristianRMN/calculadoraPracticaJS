This is my first javascript "project" where we're going to try to mimic a real calculator, pressing buttons and having them do operations
***Calculator Appearance:***

Yes, the appearance is ugly, but what matters to us at the moment is that it works.


**Summing functionality**
Here we can see that we are writing numbers in a concatenated manner

Then click on the plus (+) button.

And the numbers add up

We still have more things to do for the calculator to work, let's go with it

**Fixes and new features:**
1. We've added subtraction logic
2. Fixed bugs in the calculator when adding and subtracting


Now we're going to add more features

As we can see, apart from the colors that can be ugly, we have put the functionality of division, 
multiplication and the reset button. The only thing we need is to fix some bugs and put a couple more functionalities and 
our calculator will be done

**First version of the project**

This would be the first version of the calculator project. There are still bugs and it will be expanded with many other things,
I plan to make a web page by putting javascript and more things. Among them will be this calculator
